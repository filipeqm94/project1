# Personal Life Management App Project (WIP)

The goal of this project is to create an all-in-one app to manage several aspects of the user's life such as budget (currently in development), health*, calendar*, stocks* among others*.

*Under consideration for future roadmap

## Why?

As someone who uses multiple apps to access manage differnt aspects of my life, I thought it would be a good idea to have it all in one place, where I can easily check multiple things without going back and forth between multiple apps.

## Technologies

### Front-end
I'm using React and SASS to render the UI. As the project goes on, I might add a few other dependencies.

### Back-end
Still under consideration, I might end up using Python for [server side](https://github.com/filipeqm94/project1-server) operations. I've had some experience with Django and loved the framework.
